# FlopAI
Taking my implementation of Flop and seeing if I can make a very fundamental machine learning AI in JavaScript to solve puzzles for me. 
This project has been a great way for me to develop my understanding of Machine Learning in a very simple way and has also been quite successful.

In future I recommend using Node.js for file saving and the next ML project I'm going to be doing is hopefully 
going to be in Python so It can be more practical and efficient and so I can continue to develop my python skills.

Enjoy this simple example. I will hopefully be making improvements to this repo to make it more useable by others and not just for myself but if I haven't, I'm sorry...
Some hotkeys you'll want to know are C, G, Y, B, and Escape. I wish you luck for now... The AI's can be fiesty. You have been warned.
